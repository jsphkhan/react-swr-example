This is a CRA ReactJS example that uses SWR library to cache API data

SWR - Stale while revalidate. React Hooks library for data fetching. 
SWR is a strategy to first return the data from cache (stale), then 
send the fetch request (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data.

SWR is a library from NextJS - https://swr.vercel.app/

API data
--------
For backend API data I am using Fake JSON Server
Start Fake JSON Server (for Books Data): json-server --watch books.json --port 3004
Or use npm script: npm run fake-api

json-server was installed globally
